As envisioned in the Plan, the D-1 Block offers the potential for the relocation of the public library, private commercial space, and structured parking to serve all of Union Square. The City has partnered with US2 developers as a Master Developer Partner for the Union Square disposition parcels. Site assembly has been completed bye the SRA for the D-2 Block as the location for the Union Square Green Line Station. Authorization to expend funds for the acquisition of the D-1 parcels represents the next step in implementing the Plan. A portion of the $2.5 million funding request reflects the current aggregate assessed value of the privately owned parcels (approximately $1.9 million). The balance of the request will be allocated toward required appraisal, relocation, and legal costs, consistent with the City’s experience in assembling the D-2 Block.","The Civic Center Block is an integral part of the approved Union Square Revitalization Plan. In addition to providing a site for a new central public library and increased efficiency arising from the consolidation of municipal services, the Civic Center Block can be a catalyst for significant private investment and commercial development in the immediate area, consistent with the goals of the Plan. The authorization of funding in FY16, in advance of the actual expenditure of funds would allow the City to effectively demonstrate the ability and the means by which the SRA could assemble the Civic Center Block. It is anticipated that funds would be expended between FY17 and FY20."
